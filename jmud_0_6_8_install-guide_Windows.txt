Installing Lulu's JMUD

If you run into problems fire me a "gmail": cwmaguire

What you'll Need:

- Sun's Java SDK or JRE
- Java IDE (e.g. Netbeans) if installing from source
- JMUD source or class files
- MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver
- My SQL Database Server
- My SQL Gui package

Step One: Install the Java Runtime

Go to http://java.sun.com and figure out how to download the latest JRE or SDK
Install the JRE/SDK

Step Two: Obtaining Lulu-JMUD

Method One: Installing from the Source

Go to www.sourceforge.net/projects/lulu-jmud
Click on the "Files" link and download the latest source .zip file
Create a project called "jmud" (case matters?) in your Java IDE of choice
Unzip the source files into that project's source directory
Compile the source

Method Two: Installing from .Class files

Go to www.sourceforge.net/projects/lulu-jmud
Click on the "Files" link and download the latest binary .zip file
Unzip the class files into a directory

Step Three: Install MySQL

Go to www.mysql.com and download the latest version of the following:

- MySQL
- MySQL GUI Tools
- MySQL Connector/J JDBC Database Driver

Install all of the above

Step Four: Create the JMUD Database

Go to www.sourceforge.net/projects/lulu-jmud
Click on the "Files" link and download the latest database backup .zip file (DB-BAK)
Unzip the database backup script file into any directory

This has changed quite drastically since the last review:

a) Older versions of MySQL (I don't know exactly how old)
Open MySQL Administrator (Start -> Programs -> MySQL -> MySQL Administrator)
Click on the "Restore" button
Browse for the .sql database backup file that you just unzipped
Click "Open Backup File"

b) MySQL 5.0.67

- Start -> Programs -> MySQL System Tray Monitor
- RMB on MySQL System Tray Monitor (Looks like a sprocket with a blue bar on the right)
- Click on "Actions" -> "Manage MySQL Instances"
- Click on the "Service Control" item in the top left pane (may already be selected)
- Click on the "Configure Service" tab in the right hand pane
- Click on the "Install New Service" button at the bottom of the frame
- Configure your new MySQL instance service (I used the my-small.ini config file)
- Click on the "Apply Changes" button (go back to previous step if you get an error)
- Click on the "Start/Stop Service" tab
- Start the service
- Open MySQL Administrator (Start -> Programs -> MySQL -> MySQL Administrator)
- Log on to "localhost"
  - user is "root"
  - password is blank by default (I'm not even going to say it, you should know better)
- Click on the "Restore" button
- Browse for the .sql database backup file that you just unzipped
- Click "Open Backup File"

Step Five: Set the classpath

Note: This is for Windows only. If you are using *nix you're on your own :).

Open a command prompt: Start -> Run -> "cmd" [Enter]
Run the following command: set classpath=%classpath%;<full path to MySQL Connector/J .jar file>;
  e.g. For me the command is: C:\>set classpath=%classpath%;c:\mysql-connector-java-5.0.3\mysql-connector-java-5.0.3-bin.jar;

Step Six: Start the server

Open a command prompt: Start -> Run -> "cmd" [Enter]
If you haven't added the jmud .class directory to the classpath then change to the directory where the .class files are.
Run the following command: java jmud

Step Seven: Create a login

You can create a new login for yourself in the database or just use one that I've already created.
Logins can be found in the tblPlayers table
Open the MySQL Query Browser (Start -> Programs -> MySQL -> MySQL Query Browser)
Run this query: select vchPlayerLogin, vchPlayerPassword from tblPlayers

Step Seven: Connect to the Server

Open *another* command prompt: Start -> Run -> "cmd" [Enter]
Run this command: telnet localhost 9000

If you cannot connect you may need to open port 23 on your firewall.
