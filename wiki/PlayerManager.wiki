Discussion around the role of the PlayerManager class


= Details =

I was wondering the ideas you have for the PlayerManager class from a practical standpoint.

Would the player manager simply be a place to look up Players, or will it handle sending and receiving messages to/from client connections associated with Player objects?

Where is the control steretype defined? The closest I came on Google was a class that controls something, but it sounds like there are some particular roles that are associated with controllers vs. elements.
