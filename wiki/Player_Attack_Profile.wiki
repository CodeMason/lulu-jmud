#summary How should a Player attack a target?

== Ideas ==

  # Allow attack profiles for mob types (i.e. spiders) 
  # Allow attack profiles for mob "classes"?
    * We don't have mob classes yet
  # Allow regex patterns for matching enemies? 
    * The programming-player in me loves this idea
  # How to specify attacks
    * By limb? (e.g. Right hand)
    * By Weapon? (e.g. Sword)
    * Either or? (e.g. attack with my sword and/or my left foot)
    * Qualifiers? (e.g. Attack with my right hand if it's armored?)
  # Auto attacks? (e.g. if I run up against an easy enemy just attack automatically)
  # What attack to use when, and how often
    * Attack 5 times with my sword then kick once?
    * Event-driven attacks
      * Regex pattern matching? (e.g. cast a spell whenever /`*`.dragon.`*`tail.`*`/ is detected)
    * percentages
    * success-based attacks? (e.g. attack 5 times with everything then use what worked best)

  Almost seems like there needs to be a separate Player Attack Engine, kind of like V.A.T.S in Fallout 3.
