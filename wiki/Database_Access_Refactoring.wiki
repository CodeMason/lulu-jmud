== Introduction ==

The database access needs to be reworked and abstracted out of the common code


== Thoughts ==

The more I think about it the more I'm leaning toward an ORM (e.g. Hibernate) solution: the properties are mapped to columns automatically, the fetching is all handled on the fly, etc. 

At the minimum I'd like to see some column index constants for each sproc, which might mean putting together a SprocController that maps sprocs and result set indexes to columns  or a CallableStatement wrapper that contains human readable constants for that particular sproc. I don't like seeing magic numbers in the code that deals with result sets from sprocs because it will make DB maintenance a nightmare and it's hard to debug.
