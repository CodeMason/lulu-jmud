== Where to go from here? ==

Now that JMUD is a functioning MUD (barely) we have a lot of options for what to develop next: 

  # Colored output
  # ORM database layer
  # Finish up the inventory code
  # Flesh out the attack code
    # Using weapons
    # Multiple attacks (e.g. Foot and hand)
    # Player_Attack_Profile
  # More mapping functionality
  # In game world editing
  # NPCs
  # Shops
  # Enemy AI
